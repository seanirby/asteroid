#Asteroids

I wanted to familiarize myself with Javascript and game programming so I decided to write this Asteroids clone. For educational purposes, I decided not to use any external libraries.

You can play the game [here](http://seanirby.github.io/asteroids/index.html).

##Setup
Clone this repo and edit the root in server.rb so it points to the repo:


	... 

	root = File.expand_path '~/PATH/TO/REPO'

	...


Next start the server:


	ruby server.rb


Now visit localhost:8000 in your browser and enjoy!
