#Asteroids

I wanted to familiarize with Javascript and game programming so I decided to write this Asteroids clone without using any external libraries.

##Setup
Clone this repo and edit the root in server.rb so it points to the repo:

`
... 

root = File.expand_path '~/PATH/TO/REPO'

...
`

Next start the server:

'
ruby server.rb
'

Now visit localhost:8000 in your browser and enjoy!
